          >How the integration of Artificial Intelligence And Blockchain is
          revolutionizing the IT industry.

      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence and blockchain are hot and emerging technologies
        for the past few years. AI has evolved into leading technologies and
        powering innovation in almost every industry. While Blockchain plays an
        amazing role in securing our digital data, assuring privacy, and
        eliminating frauds. Though there are numerous benefits of both AI and
        Blockchain technology, there are also some drawbacks of both for example
        the artificial brain of an AI is fed with a large amount of data which
        is usually collected from users like us, this has raised a long
        debatable discussion on user's data privacy. On the other hand,
        blockchain is questioned on the factor of scalability, Data management
        issues, and it's high energy dependency.
      </p>
      <p>
        But with combination of these two mighty technologies they help each
        other to overcome their flaws, unlock their maximum potential for our
        benefit, and create a totally new paradigm.<br />
        Here are some key benefits list down below.
      </p>
      <h3></h3>
      <br />
      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        AI at root requires a huge amount of data, which raises challenge of
        storing data securely. The whole point of blockchain is to decentralize
        the storage of data this allows the creation of a highly secure database
        system that can be accessed by only permitted parties and are almost
        unhackable by breachers. When merging AI with blockchain, we get a
        secure system for sensitive valuable personal data of individuals. Such
        Systems would always improve them by learning and become more secure. AI
        could access the data only with permission, but once it gets through the
        proper procedure it can provide us with the best results.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Explicitness in process</h3>
      <p>
        As AI is becoming smarter it gets more complex and it is becoming
        difficult to understand what goes on under the hood and how does it
        conclude a result. But with the addition of blockchain, data scientists
        could understand every step, they can access all the immutable records
        of the procedure. This will make the auditing process easier. Whenever
        an AI result goes wrong, an inspection of the root cause can be easily
        done through these records. This makes the process transparent and
        explicit.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Data Monetization</h3>
      <p>
        Monetization of data by tech giants like Facebook and Google is a huge
        revenue source for them and is not new. This data is collected by their
        users and sold to a third party which has lifted the issue of data
        privacy. But with blockchain allowing cryptographical storage of data,
        we could monetize our data personally without compromising sensitive
        information. For AI models, companies could directly buy data from such
        data marketplaces. This will reduce the exploitation of user's data by
        tech giants.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Breakthrough for small companies</h3>
      <p>
        A lower market in IT could bypass the monopoly ownership of the tech
        giant on data. With a Decentralize Data marketplace where individuals
        sell data on a large scale, these companies can access otherwise too
        expensive, privately kept data and use it for their personalized AI. The
        spread of AI within small companies would provide enormous progress in
        the industry and open doors to new job opportunities.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h3>Production and Deployment on blockchain hosting</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to the deployment of the product cloud service are not as
        secure as blockchain. Blockchain regulated with an AI can be used for a
        decentralized hosting of applications, Providing with best security
        measures that are possible. AI improves the operational efficiency of
        such services. 
      </p>
